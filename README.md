Java Compiler Project
This is a simple compiler implementation written in Java. The compiler reads source code, performs lexical analysis, parses the code, and generates intermediate code or an output in the target language. The goal is to understand the workings of a compiler, focusing on lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and code generation.

Features
Lexical Analysis: Tokenizes the input source code into meaningful components.
Syntax Analysis: Builds a syntax tree by parsing the tokens.
Intermediate Code Generation: Generates a simplified version of the target language or intermediate code.
Error Handling: Captures syntax and lexical errors.
Structure
The compiler is structured as follows:

vbnet
Copy code
/src
  /tokenizer
    Token.java           - Token class for lexical analysis
    Tokenizer.java       - Class that processes input source code and generates tokens
  /parser
    Parser.java          - Parses tokens to create an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
  /codegen
    CodeGenerator.java   - Generates intermediate or machine code
  Compiler.java          - Main entry point for running the compiler
  Lexer.java             - Class for lexical analysis
  ParserUtils.java      - Utility class for parsing tasks
  ErrorHandler.java     - Handles error reporting
/Makefile                - Build automation for the project
README.md               - Project documentation
Key Classes
Token: Represents the building blocks of the source code (keywords, identifiers, operators, etc.).
Tokenizer: Converts the raw input source code into tokens.
Parser: Converts the list of tokens into a parse tree (abstract syntax tree).
CodeGenerator: Converts the parse tree into intermediate code or a target language representation.
Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
Text editor or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)
Setup
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/compiler-project.git
cd compiler-project
Compile the source code:
You can use the Makefile to build the project (if make is installed) or manually compile using javac.

Using Makefile:

bash
Copy code
make
Manually:

bash
Copy code
javac -d bin src/*.java
Run the Compiler:
bash
Copy code
java Compiler <source-file>
Where <source-file> is the path to the source code file you want to compile.

How it Works
Lexical Analysis (Tokenizer):

The compiler reads the source code file line by line and splits it into tokens using the Tokenizer class.
Each token is categorized into types (keywords, identifiers, operators, etc.).
Parsing:

After tokenization, the Parser class takes over. It reads the sequence of tokens and creates a syntax tree or Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
Code Generation:

Once the syntax tree is built, the CodeGenerator class converts it into a target format (could be machine code, bytecode, or an intermediate representation).
Error Handling:

If there are any errors in the input (syntax errors or invalid tokens), the ErrorHandler class will catch them and report helpful error messages.
